<b><h3>Description</h3></b>
<ul type="square">
<li>Many times, we try to replicate a picture into a sketch. The perfect charcoal and pencil strokes make any face look more extraordinary. These sketches capture the rawness of a face more truly than the photographs itself. No wonder, pencil sketches were the most complicated art form for ages.</li>
<li>Sketches have made an indelible place in the history of art as well as the hearts of artists, and that's not without reasons. The subtlety of shades in sketches and the masterstrokes that highlight the emotions on any face perfectly! They are known for the way they sit captivatingly on a wall or the side of the bed or as a gift</li>
